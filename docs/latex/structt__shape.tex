\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Represents a shape in a scene. 


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em shape} & This union of shapes represents the possible geometric forms the structure \doxylink{structt__shape}{t\+\_\+shape} can assume, i.\+e., to be a sphere, a plane, a cylinder or a cone. Each shape has its own particular values. The fields below are common properties shared by all types of shape. Each one of them is going to be manipulated (transform, inverse and transpose), be made of some matter (material) and be intersected by rays (intersect and normal\+\_\+at). \\
\hline
{\em transform} & Stores the transformation matrix for the shape. \\
\hline
{\em inverse} & Stores the inverse matrix for the shape. \\
\hline
{\em transpose} & Stores the transpose matrix for the shape. \\
\hline
{\em material} & Stores the material information of the shape. \\
\hline
{\em intersect} & Stores the function\textquotesingle{}s name used to calculate the intersection of a ray with the shape. \\
\hline
{\em normal\+\_\+at} & Stores the function\textquotesingle{}s name used to calculate the normal at a point on the shape. \\
\hline
