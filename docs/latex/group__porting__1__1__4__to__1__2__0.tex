This module describes porting from FLAC 1.\+1.\+4 to FLAC 1.\+2.\+0.  


This module describes porting from FLAC 1.\+1.\+4 to FLAC 1.\+2.\+0. 

There were only very minor changes to the interfaces from 1.\+1.\+4 to 1.\+2.\+0. In lib\+FLAC, {\ttfamily \doxylink{group__flac__format_ga996f8732a2502ad79a68bb4a9f945235}{FLAC\+\_\+\+\_\+format\+\_\+sample\+\_\+rate\+\_\+is\+\_\+subset()}} was added. In lib\+FLAC++, {\ttfamily FLAC\+::\+Decoder\+::\+Stream\+::get\+\_\+decode\+\_\+position()} was added.

Finally, value of the constant {\ttfamily FLAC\+\_\+\+\_\+\+FRAME\+\_\+\+HEADER\+\_\+\+RESERVED\+\_\+\+LEN} has changed to reflect the conversion of one of the reserved bits into active use. It used to be {\ttfamily 2} and now is {\ttfamily 1}. However the FLAC frame header length has not changed, so to skip the proper number of bits, use {\ttfamily FLAC\+\_\+\+\_\+\+FRAME\+\_\+\+HEADER\+\_\+\+RESERVED\+\_\+\+LEN} + {\ttfamily FLAC\+\_\+\+\_\+\+FRAME\+\_\+\+HEADER\+\_\+\+BLOCKING\+\_\+\+STRATEGY\+\_\+\+LEN}
