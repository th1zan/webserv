The struct t\+\_\+shearing is a helper type to allow shearing operation on matrices. Shearing (or skew) is a complex operation where the coordinate is changed in proportion to the other two coordinates. When doing it to a matrix, it means that x will change in proportion to y and z, y will change in proportion to x and z and, lastly, z will change in proportion to x and y. For example, to apply shearing to the x axis of a given matrix, we pass to \doxylink{matrices_8h_aab8a1e820c4bde5ca4973638bc86dcb7}{shearing()} a struct of type t\+\_\+shearing containing the y and z values. For instance, when done to the y axis, we pass p1 and p2 which stands for x and z. Lastly, when applying it to the z axis, we pass x and y as p1 and p2, respectively.
