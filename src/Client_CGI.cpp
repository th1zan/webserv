 * - If the file path contains the configured CGI extension.

 * @param [in] locationConfig The location configuration containing CGI settings.

 * The function is currently a placeholder and sends a 501 Not Implemented response.
 * 
 * Planned functionality:
 * - Fork a process to execute the CGI script.
 * - Use `execve()` to run the script in the child process.
 * - Capture the script's output (`stdout`) using pipes and send it as the HTTP response.
 * - Handle errors and unexpected behavior during execution.
 * 
 * @param [in] cgiPath The path to the CGI executable or interpreter (e.g., `/usr/bin/python`).
 * @param [in] filePath The path to the script or file to be executed by the CGI interpreter.
